The system requirements have not been finalized for StepMania 5.

Here are some back of the envelope specs:

-    Windows 7+ (Vista and up users: read the installer!); Linux; Mac OS X 10.6+
-    512 MB of RAM (1 GB recommended)
-    700MHz minimum (Multi-core recommended)
-    Video card with support for 16-bit color, 128MB video RAM and OpenGL 2.1 or higher.
-    DirectX 9.0 or later (Windows only)
-    Sound card (of course :D)

Unsupported systems since 5.0.12:
-    Windows XP and Vista

StepMania 3.9 (and variants)
----------------------------
-    Windows 98+, Linux, OS X 10.4-10.6
-    266MHz minimum (400 MHz or Multi-core recommended)
-    64 MB of RAM
-    Video card with support for 16-bit color, 16MB video RAM and OpenGL or Direct3D 8 drivers
-    DirectX 8.0 or later (Windows only)
-    Sound card 

It is possible that you may need to temporarily disable your antivirus when you install StepMania, but this is uncommon.

You also might have luck running on something below what is listed, but we're not crazy enough to try supporting setups that ancient.


<!-- StepMania 6 isn't happening anytime soon, so these minimum requirements are more confusing for users than helpful.  See: https://www.reddit.com/r/Stepmania/comments/fjknqq/stepmania_6_is_there_a_way_to_get_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x
