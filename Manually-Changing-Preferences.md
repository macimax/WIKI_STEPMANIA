Most preferences can (and should) be set with StepMania's UI, but there are times when you may want to manually edit *Preferences.ini* where your settings are stored.

Before attempting to edit your *Preferences.ini* file, it is important to quit StepMania first, if it is actively running.  This will ensure that any changes you make manually will stick when you start StepMania next time.

# Finding *Preferences.ini*
The location of your *Preferences.ini* file depends on your operating system.

## Windows
Path: `%appdata%\StepMania 5\Save\Preferences.ini`


## OS X
**Path:** `~/Library/Preferences/StepMania 5/Preferences.ini`

For better or worse, Apple hides the *Library* directory by default but there are a few ways to get there.

Finder's *Go* menu has a *Go To Folder...* item which brings up a dialog box.  Copy and paste the path provided above and click *Go*.

## Linux
**Path:** `~/.stepmania-5.0/Save/Preferences.ini`
