# Installing StepMania

You can download Windows and macOS installers for the [latest SM5 release](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/releases/latest) from GitHub.  

Precompiled binaries for Linux may be provided with releases, and instructions for compiling from source are also available.


## Windows
You'll need to install [DirectX and Visual Studio runtime packages](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania-site/issues/64) first.

With that done, follow along with the StepMania installer, ensuring that you **do not install to Program Files** to avoid conflicts with Windows UAC.  By default, the installer will install to `C:\Games\` and this is fine for most players.

## macOS
[Installing on macOS](Installing-on-macOS) is roundabout, but at least we have a guide that gently walks you through the process. ðŸ™‚

## Linux
If the precompiled executable is not compatible with your architecture/distro/etc., you'll likely have better luck compiling from source.
