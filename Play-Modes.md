Your regular play mode, normally with 3 stages, plus an Extra Stage if the player gets all AA's or higher (and Extra Stage is enabled), plus a Special Stage (More commonly known as Encore Extra Stage or One More Extra Stage) if the player passes the Extra Stage.

When Event Mode is enabled there are infinite stages and no Extra Stage.

The same as Course mode, but the lifebar type is set to Battery with 4 lives.

## Endless
Play songs until you fail.

## Battle
2 player battle mode.

## Rave
