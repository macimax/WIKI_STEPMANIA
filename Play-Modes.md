StepMania supports a number of play modes, normally selectable after you pick your profile and style.

### Regular
Your regular play mode, normally with 3 stages, plus an [[Extra Stage]] if the player gets all AA's or higher (and Extra Stage is enabled), plus a Special Stage (More commonly known as Encore Extra Stage or One More Extra Stage) if the player passes the Extra Stage.

When Event Mode is enabled there are infinite stages and no Extra Stage.

Some themes uses this default mode and don't be changed, some themes shown ScreenEvaluationStage (Results on actual stage) regards if any player pass or fail the song, and if the player pass FINAL STAGE, EXTRA STAGE or ENCORE EXTRA, ScreenEvaluationStage change to ScreenEvaluationSummary (TOTAL RESULTS).

### Rave
Battle against another player or a CPU. A gauge at the top determines who is winning or losing, and a gauge at the bottom fills up as you hit notes. When the gauge is full an attack modifier is temporarily applied to the opposite player.
The gauge fills up to level 3 and then restarts at 0. (I don't know if the attacks are stronger at higher levels, but probably.)

### Nonstop
Course mode. Pick a course to play a series of songs in order. It reads from .crs files in the Courses folder, but also has auto generated randomized ones from your song groups.

Note for themers: During this mode, you stay in ScreenGameplay until the course ends and then you're taken to ScreenEvaluationNormal.

### Challenge
The same as Course mode, but the lifebar type is set to 4 LIVES. Originally known as "Oni".

### Endless
Play songs until you fail.

### Battle / Versus
2 player battle mode. Basically the same as regular except there's two players.
