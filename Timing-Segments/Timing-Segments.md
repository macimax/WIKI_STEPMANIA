A **timing segment** is an element of a simfile that can affect gameplay. There are multiple types:

## BPM

## Stop
Stops scrolling for x beats/seconds.
## Delay

## Time Signature

## Warp
Anything during this segment will be skipped.
## Combo

## Tickcount
Affects the amount of combo ticks you get during a hold note in pump mode(?)

## Label

## Speed
The scroll ratio. A speed of 2 will make the song scroll twice as fast, multiplying the player's current speed.
## Scroll

## Fake
Notes during this segment won't be counted for or against you.
