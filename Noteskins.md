**Noteskins** define the appearance of notes. They are constructed in a similar manner to [Themes](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/wiki/Theming) (with a mixture of graphics, metrics, and Lua scripts), although they are, by nature, not _as_ complicated.

# Files
On StepMania 5.0 and 5.1, noteskins are specific to a single [game mode](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/wiki/Supported-Game-Modes), and consist of a series of sprites divided into several categories. They include (using the standard ``dance`` mode as an example;

* **Taps**: An individual note. These include, for instance
 * Normal notes
 * Mines
 * Lifts
* **Holds** and **Rolls**: a tail that must be held or repeatedly tapped for a length of time. They are typically divided into three parts; top and bottom caps, and a body that is tiled for the length of the note. They also have active and inactive states.
 * Some noteskins may have a **Hold Head/Roll Head**, a specific note sprite used for the note that begins a hold. They too have active and inactive states.
* **Receptors**: The targets.
* **Explosions**: Effects overlaid on the note when hit/held/etc. Some noteskins may distinguish between dim and bright explosions, triggering the latter after a specific combo milestone.

In the dance mode, all arrows typically share the same sprite, so they can just be rotated into the appropriate direction rather than having individual sprites for each direction (by contrast, Pump noteskins often use distinct sprites for each direction due to their traditional column-based color schemes). Tap notes are usually either a 2D sprite or a 3D model. For ease of explanation, these examples will use 2D noteskins.

As with themes, these sprites are generated by Lua scripts which define their constituent [actors](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/wiki/Theming#actors). In the default noteskin (which, unlike the Default theme, actually _is_ a good base to copy and paste to make your own noteskins), Down Tap Note.lua defines a common tap note with animated dots which pulse in visibility to the beat;

`local t = Def.ActorFrame {
	Def.Sprite {
		Texture="_arrow";
		Frame0000=0;
		Delay0000=1;
	};
	Def.Sprite {
		Texture="_circle";
		Frame0000=0;
		Delay0000=1;
		InitCommand=cmd(y,15;effectclock,"beat";diffuseramp;effectcolor1,color("1,1,1,0");effectcolor2,color("1,1,1,0.35");effectoffset,0);
	};
	Def.Sprite {
		Texture="_circle";
		Frame0000=0;
		Delay0000=1;
		InitCommand=cmd(y,5;effectclock,"beat";diffuseramp;effectcolor1,color("1,1,1,0");effectcolor2,color("1,1,1,0.35");effectoffset,0.25);
	};
	Def.Sprite {
		Texture="_circle";
		Frame0000=0;
		Delay0000=1;
		InitCommand=cmd(y,-5;effectclock,"beat";diffuseramp;effectcolor1,color("1,1,1,0");effectcolor2,color("1,1,1,0.35");effectoffset,0.5);
	};
	Def.Sprite {
		Texture="_circle";
		Frame0000=0;
		Delay0000=1;
		InitCommand=cmd(y,-15;effectclock,"beat";diffuseramp;effectcolor1,color("1,1,1,0");effectcolor2,color("1,1,1,0.35");effectoffset,0.75);
	};
};
return t;
