Data Locations
--------------
Modern operating systems have user profiles, which means certain files are in different locations from previous versions of StepMania.

A list of user data locations:

* **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/StepMania 5.0/`
* **Linux**: `~/.stepmania-5.0/`
* **Mac OS X**: `~/Library/Application Support/StepMania 5/`

#### Mac OS X
The *~/Library* directory is hidden from Finder by default, which makes adding content on OS X somewhat cumbersome.  You can follow the instructions from the Wiki page on [Manually Changing Preferences](Manually-Changing-Preferences) but use the path provided above to access your StepMania profile directory.
