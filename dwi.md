# The Step Syntax
Each chart consists of a string of numbers and letters. The string is usually made up of 8th notes: more specific notes can be utilized as follows:

| Beginning Character | Ending Character | Note Type |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| (                   | )                | 16th      |
| [                   | ]                | 24th      |
| {                   | }                | 64th      |
| `                   | '                | 192nd     |

The arrows are mostly represented via the numpad. The <kbd>2</kbd> key represents a down arrow, <kbd>4</kbd> a left, <kbd>6</kbd> a right, and <kbd>8</kbd> an up arrow. The <kbd>1</kbd>, <kbd>3</kbd>, <kbd>7</kbd>, and <kbd>9</kbd> keys represent the corner jumps. To have a jump with the left and right arrows, use the <kbd>B</kbd> key: up and down jumps use <kbd>A</kbd>. 

The solo mode has extra keyboard keys for representing the diagonals and their jump combinations.  These are:

| Key | Arrow Combination         |
| --- | ------------------------- |
| <kbd>C</kbd> | UpLeft           |
| <kbd>D</kbd> | UpRight          |
| <kbd>E</kbd> | UpLeft+Left      |
| <kbd>F</kbd> | UpLeft+Down      |
| <kbd>G</kbd> | UpLeft+Up        |
| <kbd>H</kbd> | UpLeft+Right     |
| <kbd>I</kbd> | UpRight+Left     |
| <kbd>J</kbd> | UpRight+Down     |
| <kbd>K</kbd> | UpRight+Up       |
| <kbd>L</kbd> | UpRight+Right    |
| <kbd>M</kbd> | UpLeft+UpRight   |


It is also possible to hit more than two arrows at once. Simply surround any combination of step/jump keys with \<Angle Brackets\>.

To allow for freeze arrows, after any valid key is typed, type in the <kbd>!</kbd> symbol followed by the arrow (or arrows) which represent the hold. When the hold is to end, simply repeat the arrow at the appropriate spot.
