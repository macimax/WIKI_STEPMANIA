Project Antenna is a proposal to revamp StepMania's netcode to offer more flexible online functionality, including the ability for passive, online service servers (akin to e-Amusement or AM.NET) that can stream player statistics and scores to a score tracking server. Unlike SMO, this would be able to occur in the background during normal gameplay, without requiring the user to log into a network lobby server in order to take advantage of such features.

# Comparison of current online functionality between SM and other products

## StepMania
 * Optional online connectivity to multiplayer servers (SMO).
 * Decentralized distribution of content (although the main SMO server does have a pack repository/hosting area with search among popular packs).
 * When SMO is active, user is prompted to login and is placed in a lobby.
 * Public and private rooms for multiple players to play the same song at once.
 * The main SMO server has a song scanning system.
 * The main SMO server manages online leaderboards and profiles for each song and player, accessible online.
 * Online functionality is exclusive to SMO mode. All other functionality is offline only unless otherwise noted.
 * The UI for SMO is rather clunky and depends on unusual variations of SM’s standard workflow, since it’s very hackish.

## Osu
 * Account required to play
 * Centralized song distribution with per-song leaderboards
 * Online functionality is passive, game was built around it from the start.
 * Has multiplayer with up to 16 players on the same song/chart (no I am not calling it a “map”.)
 * Has a better editor (I know it’s not online related but it’s still an advantage)
 * Is the subject of ridicule within certain segments of the music gaming community as a whole

## DDR 
 * Contactless card and PIN login system
 * Arcade game.
 * Rival system (compare high scores with specific friends).
 * Additional features in an app apparently (generating custom “result cards” for posting on social media, etc.)
 * Online events and updates.
 * Online functionality is passive when a machine is online-connected and the user logs in.

## Step ManiaX
 * Seems to involve results screen QR codes and a mobile app.
