Manias have been stepped all throughout the ages and here is a sampling of some of the versions used to do so:

Unofficial
----------
As StepMania is an open source project, there have been specific forks designed to serve specific niches and communities.

* AMX: A fork based, in turn, on a fork of 3.9, with a particular focus on Pump it Up-related enhancements.
* Etterna: A fork based on the 5.0.x series meant to appeal to keyboard players. It focuses on advanced user interface features and in-game statistics, performance improvements, and integration with an online score tracking website. It also trims out a number of features deemed unnecessary to its target audience.
* OpenITG: A fork based on a snapshot of StepMania's CVS tree (also known as "3.95") that was used as the basis of the arcade game _In the Groove 2_. It is designed to emulate the behavior of the game, whilst adding features and enhancements of interest to arcade environments.
  * NotITG: A branch of OpenITG that adds additional modifiers and other features of interest for the creation of simfiles with scripted effects.
* sm-ssc: A fork of the StepMania 4 alpha source code, created after StepMania 4 itself was shelved (and replaced by a new iteration of StepMania 4 that had more in common with 3.9 than the "StepMania 4 CVS" builds released before it). sm-ssc would later be merged into the main StepMania source tree, serving as the basis of the current StepMania 5.0.x series.
