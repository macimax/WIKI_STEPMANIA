# About

(This wiki page is in progress... Feel free to alter it as needed...)

Stepmania's .sm format was updated to include more tags and more organization. Thus, .scc was born. You can refer to the [.sm](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/wiki/sm) wiki to see the differences.

# Header Tags

Each TAG will have values that you can set/change. The format is as follows: TAG:VALUE; The value can be either a single line or span multiple lines. Just make sure it starts with : and ends with ;.
