# Windows
Install IO2Key, available from [Nirvash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo5m9dlNFfY). Refer to the instructions in the video.

# Linux
1. Install the [PIUIO Kernel Driver](https://github.com/djpohly/piuio)
2. DO NOT switch your input device to PIUIO, this is unnecessary.
3. Set LightsDriver=Linux_PIUIO_Leds in preferences.ini for working pad lights.
4. That's it. It shows up as a game controller. You can now map your pads.
